Research Fellow (Data Scientist),University of Westminster,"There are two posts available, both full time working 35 hours per week. One is permanent, and one is fixed term until November 2022.

The University of Westminster has been engaged in air transport research, consultancy and teaching for over 40 years. The air traffic management team is located within the School of Architecture and Cities, based at our Marylebone campus, in central London. Air traffic management has been a core area of research for over 20 years, with a very strong international reputation and with particular emphases on economics, operations, data analysis, modelling and performance. Following several successful H2020 project bids, we are now looking to expand this research area through the appointment of two Research Fellows.

The postholders will work on these new projects with the air traffic management team, led by Professor Andrew Cook. The position requires individual and collaborative research, contributions to research bids, co-authored publication work and activities to promote impact and extend the team’s research portfolio, with a high standard of written and spoken English.
The postholders will need to demonstrate skills and experience in data analysis, optimisation methods, and a range of machine learning algorithms and applications (such as predictive analytics and data mining/classification).

Shortlisted candidates will be required to make a short, technical presentation as part of their interview, on a topic to be notified on shortlisting. The interview technical arrangements will be agreed in advance with the candidate (probably Skype). The successful candidate would start ASAP thereafter.

It is likely that the initial period in post would be undertaken remotely, until such time as government guidance advises on the safety of the lifting of current restrictions. The ATM team uses remote tools extensively for its research collaborations in any case, such that issues are not foreseen with the postholders initially working remotely. No special tools are required.

To apply for this vacancy please click above. Further information can be found in the job description and person specification, which can be accessed through link below.

Closing date: midnight on 23 July 2020

Interviews are likely to be held on: 12 August 2020

Administrative contact (for queries only): Recruitment@westminster.ac.uk

Please note: We are unable to accept applications by email. All applications must be made online. CVs in isolation or incomplete application forms will not be accepted.

We are fortunate to receive a large number of applications for our vacancies. Regrettably, we are not able to provide feedback to those job applicants who are not shortlisted, as it simply would not be manageable to do so.

Senior Data Scientist,Agrimetrics,"CAREERS
Senior Data Scientist
Reading or Harpenden · Full Time
Role Description and Person Specification:
As a Senior Data Scientist, reporting to a Data Science Team Leader, you will join a team with a mix of backgrounds in complex domains like agrifood and life sciences, with skills across computing and statistics. You will develop analytical capabilities, predictive models and data processing pipelines that embed analytics and insights into our, and our customers', daily operations.
About Agrimetrics
Mission
Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.
Products, services and customers
Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:


Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.
Funding
Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

[1] Along with our sister Agri-Tech Centres: Agri-EPI, CHAP and CIEL (www.agritechcentres.com)
Locations
We are located at Rothamsted Campus in Harpenden, Herts, AL5 2JQ and at the Reading Enterprise Centre in Reading, Berks, RG6 6BU. Roles are based at either location.

"Senior Data Scientist, Operations",Monzo,"We're looking for a curious, adaptable Data Scientist to join the Data & Customer Operations teams at Monzo!
You'll have the chance to analyse all aspects of our customer support operations and help the teams scale how we work to support millions of customers.
We have a strong culture of data-driven decision making across the whole company. And we're great believers in powerful, real-time analytics and empowerment of the wider business. All our data lives in one place and is super easy to use. 90% of everyday data-driven decisions are covered by self-serve analytics through Looker, which gives data scientists the head space to focus on more impactful business questions and analyses.
The Data & Customer Operations teams
The data team's mission is to
Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster
This mission encompasses three major areas of work: (1) product analytics, to help teams understand our customers and improve our app (2) domain analytics, to support teams who are working in specific banking disciplines (e.g., lending, operations, finance, and financial crime), and (3) machine learning, where we design and build system that automate decisions across Monzo. While we take a flexible approach and frequently help each other across these areas, we each have one domain as our primary focus. We work in cross-functional squads, so every data scientist is a member of the central data team as well as fully embedded into an area such as operations or product squads.
For this role, we are looking for a Data Scientist/Analyst who will focus on customer operations analytics. You'll be working at the intersection of the Data & Customer Operations teams.
The Customer Operations team looks after the tasks within Monzo that scale with customers. They're a crucial link between Monzo and our customers. Customer Operations spans multiple product squads, a planning team, an incubator team and almost 1,000 passionate COps (that's what we call our agents). All of these teams work to make sure we can support Monzo's explosive growth through running a variety of optimization projects for Customer Operations.
The role
The Customer Operations team are solving some of the most exciting problems in Monzo. There are lots of unsolved, hard problems where data plays a key part but you will also need to think deeply about people, product and process when solving these problems.
A few examples of questions and challenges:
How do we balance (i) providing an amazing customer experience (ii) cultivating a positive and motivating culture for our customer support agents and (iii) being the most efficient and flexible operations team in the industry.
How can we automate our processes in a way that will allow us to scale to 1 billion customers and thousands of COps?
How can we measure and optimise a system that handles thousands of queries a week? What product improvements can we make? How can we understand if these are impactful?
What are our customers contacting us about & when/how can we automate the answer to their question? (partnering with the machine learning and software engineering teams)
How can we drive efficiency by 20% for our customer operations? What is the best way to measure efficiency?
What sets the most effective COps (the lovely customer support people who chat to our customers) apart?
What is a good customer experience? How can we measure this? How can we optimise for this?
You will help us make data-driven decisions and shape the direction of this exciting and evolving part of the Monzo business. We're looking for someone who cares deeply about understanding our business and customers, who can communicate their findings clearly to business partners and can drive actions on top of insights.
What's special about data at Monzo?
Autonomy. We believe that people reach their full potential when you can remove all the operational obstacles out of their way and let them run with their ideas. This comes together with a strong sense of ownership for your projects. At Monzo, you will get full access to our data and analytics infrastructure. When you discover something interesting, there is nothing stopping you from exploring and implementing your coolest ideas.
Cutting-edge managed infrastructure. All our data infrastructure lives on the Google Cloud Platform, so you don't need to spend your time configuring or managing clusters, databases, etc. If you want to train a Machine Learning model faster, just spin up a compute engine instances and submit a job from your local machine, no DevOps skills required.
Automation. We aim to automate as much as we can, so that every person in the team can focus on the things that humans do best. As with all data science work, there's some analysis and reporting, and as much as possible we encourage self-serve access to our data through Looker.

You should apply if:
What we're doing here at Monzo excites you!
You want to have a real positive impact on the company, product, users and your colleagues
You pro-actively identify issues, and enjoy tackling them and coming up with solutions
You're comfortable getting hands-on and taking a step back to think strategically
You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on
You have solid grounding in SQL and preferably Python
You are happiest exploring data, making discoveries and understanding their implications
You can manage multiple stakeholders with competing priorities
Logistics
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
We offer share options and competitive salaries based on skills and experience, which could be anywhere between £49,000 - £80,000 per year.
We're usually always hiring for Data Scientist, so there's no closing date for this job.
Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a take home task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, from home or as a job-share, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.

…and some other key skills & experience you’ll ideally have
Experience working in marketplace ecommerce businesses
