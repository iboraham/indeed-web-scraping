Senior Data Scientist,Agrimetrics,"CAREERS
Senior Data Scientist
Reading or Harpenden · Full Time
Role Description and Person Specification:
As a Senior Data Scientist, reporting to a Data Science Team Leader, you will join a team with a mix of backgrounds in complex domains like agrifood and life sciences, with skills across computing and statistics. You will develop analytical capabilities, predictive models and data processing pipelines that embed analytics and insights into our, and our customers', daily operations.
About Agrimetrics
Mission
Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.
Products, services and customers
Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:


Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.
Funding
Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

[1] Along with our sister Agri-Tech Centres: Agri-EPI, CHAP and CIEL (www.agritechcentres.com)
Locations
We are located at Rothamsted Campus in Harpenden, Herts, AL5 2JQ and at the Reading Enterprise Centre in Reading, Berks, RG6 6BU. Roles are based at either location.
About you:
You are a very experienced and adaptable Data Scientist.

You have a genuine passion for, and interest in, solving societal challenges and seeing your work make a real difference.

You believe that data can make the difference.

You strongly identify with our Values:
Innovation
Inspiration
Integrity
Interdependence[1]

You are ""T-shaped""[2] :
Real-world practitioner experience across a range of disciplines, collaborating with experts in other spaces -
Bringing a ""superpower"" to the team – an area of deep expertise in which you will lead our thinking and own solving our problems.

You are:
Comfortable working face-to-face and remotely as part of a collaborative multi-disciplinary team in a lean and agile environment
A self-starter
Able to deal with ambiguity[3]
An excellent communicator
Well organised
Keen to learn and grow through continuous improvement
A coach for others.

Predictive analytics (including machine learning, data assimilation, modelling and statistics)
Patterns and anomalies, or
Goal-driven systems.

Programming languages:
Proficiency in Python and common data processing and modelling libraries such as pandas and TensorFlow. R is a nice-to-have but not a requirement.

This mission encompasses three major areas of work: (1) product analytics, to help teams understand our customers and improve our app (2) domain analytics, to support teams who are working in specific banking disciplines (e.g., lending, operations, finance, and financial crime), and (3) machine learning, where we design and build system that automate decisions across Monzo. While we take a flexible approach and frequently help each other across these areas, we each have one domain as our primary focus. We work in cross-functional squads, so every data scientist is a member of the central data team as well as fully embedded into an area such as operations or product squads.
For this role, we are looking for a Data Scientist/Analyst who will focus on customer operations analytics. You'll be working at the intersection of the Data & Customer Operations teams.
The Customer Operations team looks after the tasks within Monzo that scale with customers. They're a crucial link between Monzo and our customers. Customer Operations spans multiple product squads, a planning team, an incubator team and almost 1,000 passionate COps (that's what we call our agents). All of these teams work to make sure we can support Monzo's explosive growth through running a variety of optimization projects for Customer Operations.
The role
The Customer Operations team are solving some of the most exciting problems in Monzo. There are lots of unsolved, hard problems where data plays a key part but you will also need to think deeply about people, product and process when solving these problems.
A few examples of questions and challenges:
How do we balance (i) providing an amazing customer experience (ii) cultivating a positive and motivating culture for our customer support agents and (iii) being the most efficient and flexible operations team in the industry.
How can we automate our processes in a way that will allow us to scale to 1 billion customers and thousands of COps?
How can we measure and optimise a system that handles thousands of queries a week? What product improvements can we make? How can we understand if these are impactful?
What are our customers contacting us about & when/how can we automate the answer to their question? (partnering with the machine learning and software engineering teams)
How can we drive efficiency by 20% for our customer operations? What is the best way to measure efficiency?
What sets the most effective COps (the lovely customer support people who chat to our customers) apart?
What is a good customer experience? How can we measure this? How can we optimise for this?
You will help us make data-driven decisions and shape the direction of this exciting and evolving part of the Monzo business. We're looking for someone who cares deeply about understanding our business and customers, who can communicate their findings clearly to business partners and can drive actions on top of insights.
What's special about data at Monzo?
Autonomy. We believe that people reach their full potential when you can remove all the operational obstacles out of their way and let them run with their ideas. This comes together with a strong sense of ownership for your projects. At Monzo, you will get full access to our data and analytics infrastructure. When you discover something interesting, there is nothing stopping you from exploring and implementing your coolest ideas.
Cutting-edge managed infrastructure. All our data infrastructure lives on the Google Cloud Platform, so you don't need to spend your time configuring or managing clusters, databases, etc. If you want to train a Machine Learning model faster, just spin up a compute engine instances and submit a job from your local machine, no DevOps skills required.
Automation. We aim to automate as much as we can, so that every person in the team can focus on the things that humans do best. As with all data science work, there's some analysis and reporting, and as much as possible we encourage self-serve access to our data through Looker.

You should apply if:
What we're doing here at Monzo excites you!
You want to have a real positive impact on the company, product, users and your colleagues
You pro-actively identify issues, and enjoy tackling them and coming up with solutions
You're comfortable getting hands-on and taking a step back to think strategically
You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on
You have solid grounding in SQL and preferably Python
You are happiest exploring data, making discoveries and understanding their implications
You can manage multiple stakeholders with competing priorities
Logistics
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
We offer share options and competitive salaries based on skills and experience, which could be anywhere between £49,000 - £80,000 per year.
We're usually always hiring for Data Scientist, so there's no closing date for this job.
Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a take home task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, from home or as a job-share, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.
Products, services and customers
Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:


Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.
Funding
Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

[1] Along with our sister Agri-Tech Centres: Agri-EPI, CHAP and CIEL (www.agritechcentres.com)
Locations
We are located at Rothamsted Campus in Harpenden, Herts, AL5 2JQ and at the Reading Enterprise Centre in Reading, Berks, RG6 6BU. Roles are based at either location.

Strong leadership and influencing skills, adapting your decision making to different levels of ambiguity and urgency
Ability to switch between strategic visioning and getting into the detail, being the authority in all aspects of your product

Broadway is seeking Senior Software Engineers to develop state-of-the-art C++ applications for our groundbreaking automated trading platform. We are a rapidly growing international enterprise software company built and run by engineers. Our technology makes it simple to create, combine, and extend large-scale, high-performance intelligent systems in ways that were never before possible.

Broadway’s solutions are built on the TOC, our core platform for scalable high-performance distributed computing. For over a decade, we’ve been using the TOC to build intelligent trading systems for leading financial institutions. We’re now starting to leverage the same technology to solve real-time problems across every industry.

You will own (typically multiple months-long) development projects end-to-end at the forefront of one of the most exciting areas in fintech, from conception through support and maintenance, including many fast-cycle version iterations. As part of our remarkably high-performing team of collaborative, talented engineers who thrive on building the most advanced technology, you will have significant freedom and self-direction to tackle a wealth of interesting, challenging problems as we push the technological envelope.

Culture
We’re not just engineering systems, we’re engineering a company. Preserving our culture is the most important thing to us as we scale. It’s the way we come together to find the best solutions, and how we hold ourselves accountable to achieving our vision: delivering success for our customers and meaningful experiences for our people.

Do Something Big: The future promises a lot—the Internet of Everything, smart connected cities, transparent markets, virtual medicine—but these advances require more than what's possible with conventional solutions. We’ve developed a new way to build distributed systems. For over a decade, we’ve used it to build complex trading systems for the world’s largest financial institutions, and now we’re starting to solve real-time problems across every industry.

Blaze Your Own Trail: We’re at an exciting stage—small but growing fast. There are unprecedented opportunities to learn and lead right away. Whatever your goals, from heads-down development to collaborating with customers, from executing and streamlining our business to leading teams, from innovating new products to opening up new industries, or a bit of “all of the above"", we’ll work together to get you there. There is no one path. You’ll have the freedom to follow your interests as they evolve.

Solve Hard Problems: The engineering we do is complex—thousands of globally distributed components, vast amounts of fast-moving shared data, continuous real-time analysis and execution, always-on mission-critical performance. It ordinarily takes years to solve these problems (think aerospace or flight control) but that’s not an option for us. Our fintech executes hundreds of billions of dollars in trades each day, so there’s huge value in launching ideas fast. We invent smarter designs and smarter ways to develop and test, so we can innovate in quick cycles without compromising the exacting requirements inherent to the systems we build.

Be Greater Together: We tackle problems no one could solve alone, so we’re here to learn from each other. Each insight is a springboard for the next. We encourage disagreement to achieve a greater outcome. But solving hard problems is only part of the equation—we hire people who inspire us and enjoy working together. The result is a team that truly “clicks”.

Do the Right Thing: Building a healthy, lasting company starts from the inside out. Our progressive policies and practices foster transparency, integrity, openness, and forward thinking. We are deeply committed to building a company that empowers people, enables them to thrive throughout their careers, and do big things here.

A sound understanding of the mathematical foundations of your methods (calculus, linear algebra, statistics, probability)
Excellent SQL skills
Experience presenting your work to, and gathering requirements from, non-technical stakeholders
…and some other key skills & experience you’ll ideally have
Experience working in marketplace ecommerce businesses
Implementation of cloud-based ML solutions
Mentoring junior team members or graduates
Using R
Applying deep learning techniques
Statistical/probabilistic knowledge of hypothesis (A/B) testing
Writing good quality code which is designed to be reusable, testable and automatically deployable
Agile/Lean working practices

Because having a break is important for your physical and mental wellbeing, our holiday allowance is 25 days (plus bank holidays) AND your entitlement increases an extra day for every 2 years you spend with us.

The team spirit at NOTHS House is legendary, and while we all miss the in-office massages, hair cuts and the abundance of free fruit, we’ve taken to our virtual world with gusto and bring the team together regularly for socials and of course the odd Zoom quiz!

We endeavour to support our people to make sure work….well, works for them. And the pretty big issue of the recent global pandemic has propelled us into working more flexibly than ever before. With the office closed until further notice (at least until government social distancing advice has changed), we’re using the lessons learnt over this period to evolve our approach to flexible working whilst ensuring we all still get together as one #teamnoths

Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to equal opportunities and to building a more diverse and inclusive team and are working with our recently formed internal community in driving progress.

Apply to join #teamnoths

We’d love to hear more about you, your experience and why you’d like to join our team.

For now, our recruitment and induction processes are fully remote, taking advantage of the wonders of modern-day technology. If you are successful in your initial application we’ll explain more about next steps, as this can vary slightly from role to role. Good luck!"

Policy Leadership Roles,UK Government - Department of Health and Social Ca...,"Examples of the types of role we have within the Group are:

Leading on adult social care charging reform: Social care charging policy is a varied and high profile policy area that has a tangible impact on people who need care and support. Our work is at the heart of public debate – the 2019 Conservative manifesto commits Government to finding ‘a long term solution for social care’. DHSC Ministers and other Government Departments including HM Treasury and Cabinet Office take a close interest in the policy, providing the opportunity to develop and demonstrate strengths in communicating with Ministers and senior leaders, and tackling complex policy issues. The work ranges from considering fundamental questions about the role of government in supporting people with care needs, to negotiating policy solutions with a range of colleagues across government, to understanding the legal and analytical complexities of specific policy proposals.

Leading on Covid and cross-cutting issues relating to the adult social care workforce. The workforce at are the heart of everything that happens in social care. Working in social care requires both skill and commitment to values of caring for others, but people working in social care often feel unrecognised and undervalued in our society. We need to put in place the frameworks, policies and programmes to change that and support employers to recruit enough people with the right skills and values to meet the needs of all citizens who need care and support. Over the past few months this has including agreeing, funding and communication infection control measures, putting in place a package of mental health and well being support for the 1.5 million strong workforce and working with colleagues cross the department to put in place a Life Assurance Scheme for the families of care worker who have sadly died from Covid 19. You will lead a unit of c10 people including 2 or 3 G7 team leaders.

Leading on the improving the experience of social care and the wellbeing of adults with care and support needs: social care in England delivers vital support for over a million adults with varied needs and abilities. These adults include older people, including those with dementia, learning disabled people and those with physical disabilities. DHSC works closely with these adults, their families and carers to ensure that government understands their views about the support they need to live as independently as possible and lead fulfilling lives. Like everyone in the UK, the lives of these people have been, and will continue to be, affected by the pandemic – social care services have been under pressure and will continue to change as we adapt to life with Coronavirus and beyond. This post, within the quality team, will have a focus on improving the how the system delivers the best possible care for adults with support needs, advocating on their behalf across Whitehall in both the design of adult social care services and other services that impact on the provision of care. As the new Social Care Directorate develops, Ministers are keen to see more work in this area, with stronger Departmental oversight of the quality of social care and to better use the insight and experience of users, their families and carers in the polices we design. The post holder will have a unique opportunity to build and shape this workstream, leading a team to make real difference to people with care needs, in care settings and in the community.

Leading on delivering the Spending Review for adult social care. Putting social care on a sustainable footing, where everyone is treated with dignity and respect, is at the core of this Government’s programme. Ensuring that the adult social care sector has enough money to deliver high quality care is essential to delivering this ambition. Working with policy teams and analysts from across the social care group, DHSC and government, the postholder will rapidly build a coherent and robust case for funding. The SR will be an exciting, fast-paced and stretching programme of work to deliver, with significant levels of Ministerial interest. The work ranges from building an understanding of future demand for care, to developing a deeper understanding how Local Authorities spend money on social care. You would be part of a friendly and growing team, who are currently working hard to ensure the system has enough money in the short term to respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic. The postholder would oversee a unit of ~8, comprised of two G7-led teams.

Lead provider market policy. The provider markets team is focused on ensuring the social care provider market is dynamic, sustainable and able to deliver seamless high-quality care to those who need it.

Solutions Architects are responsible for creating and presenting technical content and sharing best practices.

Solutions Architects are responsible for the overall technical relationship between customers and AWS and make recommendations on security, cost, performance, reliability and operational efficiency. They work to understand the customer's needs and give prescriptive guidance on how to create business value with AWS technology. Solutions Architects lead activities such as architecture reviews, white-boarding sessions, demos and technical workshops. They collaborate with other teams such as account management, professional services, support, product teams and the AWS partner ecosystem.

At Amazon you will be encouraged and rewarded for doing what is right for the long-term success of the customer. We value your passion to discover, invent and build on behalf of customers.

Amazon has always been, and always will be, committed to inclusion and diversity. We seek builders from all backgrounds to join our teams, and we encourage our employees to bring their authentic, original, and best selves to work.

Roles and Responsibilities
Work directly with customers to accelerate their mission-critical projects and recommend best-practice architectures in line with their long-term business outcomes.
Build technical relationships with customers up to C-Suite and operate as their trusted advisor. The best interests of the customer will shape the guidance you provide.
Share the voice of the customer to inform the roadmap of AWS features.
Participate in the creation and sharing of best practices, technical content and new reference architectures (e.g. white papers, code samples, blog posts).
Evangelize and educate about AWS technology (e.g. through workshops, user groups, meetups, public speaking, online videos or conferences).

Senior Software Engineer (£50-70k),Made Tech,"CORONAVIRUS UPDATE: Hiring at Made Tech continues as usual. Our team are now all working remotely so all interviews will be facilitated remotely too. Hopefully this will still be a good experience for candidates. (feedback welcome)
We're even setup to on-board any new starters remotely should we need to. All our projects are setup to continue remotely as well
-
NOTE: We currently have no open roles at this level for London at this time. We review our requirements frequently and would encourage you to register your interest for this role. You will receive a response from and we'll keep you posted on upcoming live roles at this level :)

Salary range is £50-70k per annum plus a range of excellent benefits. Apply below.

Our Senior Software Engineers are senior contributors to digital, data and technology outcomes that improve society. They do this by delivering and architecting software, and coaching others to do so in public sector organisations, while constantly striving to be nice humans :)
What does the job entail?

We primarily write and deliver custom software for the public sector. We work across central and local government, as well as in health, and our past lies in the technology startup world. Technical excellence for us isn’t about delivering to feature lists. We place a strong emphasis on outcome-based delivery; ensuring our customer’s goals are understood and achieved with the technology we deploy.
Senior Software Engineers find themselves working on a variety of different problems from monoliths to microservices, upskilling colleagues and customers, always finding themselves learning from others, while constantly striving to be nice humans :)
Our teams have used Ruby with Rails and Sinatra, ES6 with React and Angular 2, C# with .NET Core. We don’t limit ourselves as a company and we expect all our Engineers to be keen on learning new technologies. Automation is important to our teams, so we make sure there is a CD pipeline set up to build, test, and release many times per day.
High performing software delivery teams need to be empowered to iteratively and rapidly deliver changes all the way through to production. To do this we combine our extensive cloud automation knowledge with DevOps culture.
We've been using AWS from the start and as Advanced Partners are go to experts within the public sector. We use a range of IaaS, PaaS and FaaS depending on the needs of our users, in this case software teams, such as EC2, Lambda, ECS, Kubernetes, Heroku, CloudFoundry, Azure App Services, and more. We use VPC and PrivateLink for connecting to on-premise, legacy systems. We also use API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, SQS, SNS, SES, RDS, and many other services provided by AWS.
We ensure we document our architecture and infrastructure as code, using technologies such as Terraform and OpenAPI. Containerisation is a big part of empowering our teams to develop, deploy and scale their applications, but so too is using AWS Lambda and avoiding the complexity of stateful services altogether. Right tool for the job.
For us, DevOps is about culture rather than roles and titles. Even though this role is for someone with strong DevOps experience, the biggest impact you will have is coaching and helping teams use the platforms you build. You won't be building infrastructure in isolation or charged with deploying other peoples work into production. You'll empower teams with the mantra: you build it, you run it!
We grow a team of polyglot programmers, which you might already consider yourself to be, who are versed in a mix of paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, declarative, event-based and aspect-oriented. To create this environment our Senior Software Engineers need to embrace sharing their knowledge and skills with others, and they need to keep an open mind – we’d love to hear some examples of mentoring, coaching and growing team members. Maybe you will have written some blog posts about your discipline, or perhaps even delivered a talk or two.

What experience are we looking for?
While we will look for you to have experience in these things, if you don’t have one of these don’t let that stop you applying.

About the Technology team

Engineers join us for the technical challenges we overcome and stay for the incredible culture our Engineers create and grow, from talking at meetups such as the monthly 'London Microservices Meetup' to contributing regularly to open source software (we're lucky to have the core contributor to Vue.js in our ranks).

Culture
We’re not just engineering systems, we’re engineering a company. Preserving our culture is the most important thing to us as we scale. It’s the way we come together to find the best solutions, and how we hold ourselves accountable to achieving our vision: delivering success for our customers and meaningful experiences for our people.
Do Something Big: The future promises a lot—the Internet of Everything, smart connected cities, transparent markets, virtual medicine—but these advances require more than what's possible with conventional solutions. We’ve developed a new way to build distributed systems. For over a decade, we’ve used it to build complex trading systems for the world’s largest financial institutions, and now we’re starting to solve real-time problems across every industry.
Blaze Your Own Trail: We’re at an exciting stage—small but growing fast. There are unprecedented opportunities to learn and lead right away. Whatever your goals, from heads-down development to collaborating with customers, from executing and streamlining our business to leading teams, from innovating new products to opening up new industries, or a bit of “all of the above"", we’ll work together to get you there. There is no one path. You’ll have the freedom to follow your interests as they evolve.
Solve Hard Problems: The engineering we do is complex—thousands of globally distributed components, vast amounts of fast-moving shared data, continuous real-time analysis and execution, always-on mission-critical performance. It ordinarily takes years to solve these problems (think aerospace or flight control) but that’s not an option for us. Our fintech executes hundreds of billions of dollars in trades each day, so there’s huge value in launching ideas fast. We invent smarter designs and smarter ways to develop and test, so we can innovate in quick cycles without compromising the exacting requirements inherent to the systems we build.
Be Greater Together: We tackle problems no one could solve alone, so we’re here to learn from each other. Each insight is a springboard for the next. We encourage disagreement to achieve a greater outcome. But solving hard problems is only part of the equation—we hire people who inspire us and enjoy working together. The result is a team that truly “clicks”.
Do the Right Thing: Building a healthy, lasting company starts from the inside out. Our progressive policies and practices foster transparency, integrity, openness, and forward thinking. We are deeply committed to building a company that empowers people, enables them to thrive throughout their careers, and do big things here.

In 2019, our team tripled to nearly 100 people, and together we achieved huge commercial, technical and people success. Our plans for 2020 and beyond are big and exciting, and our team is growing fast.

A robust set of shared values unites our team. We invest in each other to ensure every Attester has the opportunity, support and encouragement to realise their full potential. We strongly believe everyone should have the autonomy to freely explore new ideas and have a voice in shaping the future of Attest, whilst making sure that the work we do genuinely makes a difference.

About the Account Management team

The Account Management team is part of the wider Customer Success function at Attest, where Account Managers and the Attest Centre of Excellence (ACE) partner closely to delight our customers and expand adoption and usage of Attest through ever increasing client satisfaction and value. The Account Management team’s mission is to retain and grow existing subscription accounts, with client happiness being central to achieving the team’s financial goals.

About the role

As a Senior Account Manager at Attest, you will be a truly cross-functional collaborator, partnering primarily with sales, ACE, product, legal, finance as well as other teams across the business. You’ll bring ever greater improvements to the way our customers use and derive value from our product, and equally, leverage feedback trends and patterns of customer usage to help improve our product direction. You’ll thrive in this role if you have experience significantly expanding subscription-based opportunities in a SaaS scale-up, have developed deep and scalable expertise and proven success in retaining and growing a subscription-based book of business, and are now looking for true responsibility and autonomy in a role that you can make your own and have meaningful impact on the business in.

The mission for this role…

Deeply understand our customers’ challenges and how we can help solve them. You will become an expert at connecting with the requirements and goals of Attest’s customers. You will have full ownership of retaining and growing your annual subscription-based book of business, through demonstrating ever better value and helping customers meet their business goals.

Apply a human-centric approach to identifying growth. In your approach to account management, you strike the ideal balance between first-class, human-centric relationship management and identifying, acting upon, and closing growth opportunities. You are equally hungry to learn about the customer and be of genuine value as you are to increase the commercial value of the opportunity for Attest. In working with you, customers will feel you are truly seeking to help, rather than merely capitalise on their budgets.

Build strong relationships. You will be a natural relationship builder; you will be quick to build exceptionally robust relationships with customer contacts. Whether you are partnering with a decision-maker or not, you value all perspectives and understand the value of every member of the customer organisation being seen and heard by Attest.

Leverage opportunity and anticipate the future. You are able to identify current and future stakeholders within existing accounts and have deep experience of collaborating with the customer to identify opportunities for growth in existing accounts. You understand that having excellent relationships with multiple stakeholders in an organisation is crucial to delivering the best possible value for the customer. In doing so you’ll ensure the adoption of Attest products now and in the future.

You may be a good fit if you…

> You are a senior, strategic Account Manager with experience in a fast-moving SaaS scale-up
> You are target oriented and thrive under pressure or when faced with novel challenges
> You value team success as highly as personal successes and support those around you

> You know how to get the very best out of existing client relationships both in terms of creating customer evangelists, and in terms of ARR growth
> You have a naturally positive outlook, are hungry to learn, and you operate at your best with true autonomy and responsibility in your role

Although not required, this role may be of particular interest to you if…

> You have knowledge or experience of the market research industry
> You enjoy utilising and getting the most out of Gainsight and Salesforce
> You are as comfortable and familiar working with large-scale and high-value accounts as you are expanding high-potential growth accounts
> You have experience of partnering closely with Customer Success or Experience teams; you may have even worked in a CSM role in the past.
> You are passionate about data and excited about what we’re doing at Attest!

Fixed Term Contract

Helping the trading teams and other business units to understand their performance, how their market is evolving, and the experience they give our customers is vital to the success of the business.

In the Insights team, we do this through our team of business partners who work directly with the category teams and other business units to create, collate and compile complex and varied sources of data and research in order to inform key business decisions from a customer perspective.

This role manages that team of business partners and so the relationships with key senior stakeholders, ensuring that the customer is at the heart of our decision making and the business has access to the insights it needs.

What you need to do

This role will lead a team that combine our existing tools and sources of data with additional quantitative and qualitative primary research to bring a customer perspective to key business decisions. Specifically:-
Understanding the key strategic priorities for business divisions (as examples: Fresh, Grocery, Own Brand)
Combining customer & financial analytics, quantitative & qualitative research to bring a customer perspective to these priorities
Building the use of customer insight across the teams within the department / division by training and embed self-service tools (e.g. Sainsbury’s Insight Platform, Lettuce Know) into the relevant teams
Unpicking category performance in the context of the market and competitive environment working closely with the category teams to lead discussion with senior stakeholders
Creating and building a process to identify new missions and usage occasions that the business can develop and go after and integrating this into the Food Commercial teams
Owning the relationships with key data partners, such as Nielsen, Kantar
What you need to know

This role is key in shaping the understanding of our customers & performance within Trading, so you'll need to:-
Influence at a senior level across the business
Think strategically, working in a hypothesis-led way to break down complex problems and land the answer with the business
Understand, challenge and analyse data, whilst stepping back to bring clarity to decisions
Understand how to bring together varied sources of first and third party data, working closely with a variety of agencies
Lead and coach your team to do this

Organisation DATA ANALYTICS TRANSFORMATION DIR
Job Posting 05-Jul-2020, 6:01:00 PM

The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. Our mission is to deliver monetary and financial stability for the British people.

The Bank of England is a diverse organisation. Each of its 4,000 plus people are committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.

Directorate Overview
The Bank’s mission depends on data and analytics, through their role in the Bank's decisions, its operations, and the information it provides to the public.

Data and analytics have received a new level of senior attention and backing in the Bank, following Huw van Steenis' Future of Finance review, the Bank's response, and the Governor's Mansion House speech. The Bank is now publicly committed to delivering a ""world class regtech and data strategy"". A new Directorate, Data Analytics and Transformation (DAT), headed by Gareth Ramsay, has been created to lead on this. DAT is the Bank’s centre of expertise for data strategy implementation and the compilation, dissemination and publication of regulatory and statistical data. We support analysis, policy and decision making by the Bank’s Committees, UK government departments and international organisations. Key stakeholders for our work include MPC, FPC and PRA Boards and our data are used in the Inflation Report, Financial Stability Report, Credit Conditions Review, Stress Test Results, FPC Core Indicators and Quarterly Bulletin. Decisions made in these Boards and from these reports have national economic significance.”

Data Strategy Implementation Division
Within DAT, a new division called Data Strategy Implementation Division (DSID) leads the definition and implementation of the Bank's data and analytics strategy. This strategy touches on practically all functions of the Bank, due to the central importance of data and analysis in our daily work. It also affects the firms from whom we collect data under statutory powers, the domestic and international official sector bodies with whom we share our data and analytics, and the public who receive data and analytics outputs published by the Bank.

Through the 2020s we intend to transform the way the Bank defines and collects data, the way it manages data and its capacity to analyse it, to make our use of data and analytics as insightful, reliable and efficient as possible. In addition, DSID leads the operation of the shared data and analytics services that mean colleagues can harness the power of data and analytics in their ‘business as usual (BAU)’ work today.

The Analytics Enablement Hub (AEH) was established last year to provide a Bank-wide analytics strategy and the support needed to help colleagues realise the potential of our data, and the analytical tools and platforms available to them. The AEH is a virtual team composed of colleagues from different areas across the Bank. They collaborate together to provide a cohesive, easy to access, supported self-service model utilising the skills and expertise we have. The core teams within AEH comprises teams from DSID (Data Analytics and Transformation) and Data and Analytics Modelling (Technology).

The Data and Analytics Platform Strategy and Implementation Team
The Data and Analytics Platform Strategy and Implementation Team is a new team, within DSID, and will augment the current core team, sitting within the Analytics Enablement Hub, that has the remit of implementing the strategy around our Data & Analytics Platform. This D&A Platform, with Bank-wide scope, will be live at the end of the year and will be the reference platform for self-service analytics across the Bank. For this reason we have designed an ambitious, and industry leading, operating model that is a step-change regarding how analytical platforms across the Bank are managed.
The strategy we have designed ensures:

Colleagues across the Bank can quickly add new, and maintain existing, datasets
Colleagues across the Bank can quickly find, trust and use datasets in the platform
Colleagues across the Bank can quickly make use of their datasets by setting-up reproducible, and performant, analytical pipelines
Data Stewards (those accountability for datasets in the Bank) are assured that their data are used in a governed, secured environment
The platform is kept up-to-date and delivering continuous business value

We fully expect this operating model to transform the way a considerable portion of the Bank’s data & analytics landscape will be supported in the future.

We are spiritually agile, not religiously agile.
We strongly believe in the value of good design. We believe it is a primary differentiator in an increasingly crowded marketplace.

No matter what the role we want everyone to be obsessed with getting inside the minds of our customers.

We’d also love it if you already know a Stats package like R or SPSS or at least a desire to learn that and any other new tools.
Able to clearly communicate your findings to a business audience and challenge product colleagues on taking data driven decisions. You’ll do this with your natural data analytics skills and creative problem solving ability and ability to organise yourself and project manager pieces of work end to end.

Organisation DATA ANALYTICS TRANSFORMATION DIR
Job Posting 15-Jul-2020, 7:40:10 AM

The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. Our mission is to deliver monetary and financial stability for the British people.

The Bank of England is a diverse organisation. Each of its 4,000 plus people are committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.
The Data and Statistics Division (DSD), part of the Data and Analytics Transformation Directorate (DAT), is the central data division with responsibilities that span production and management of some of the Bank’s core datasets to aspects of data management and data culture that reach into the working lives of almost all Bank staff. This is a time of significant change as the way we collect and manage data, and compile statistics, evolves in the light of the use of new technology with DSD at the forefront. The change draws on a wide range of skill sets, including: data management; data science; operational work; subject matter expertise in aspects of economics, statistics and banking and insurance supervision; and people and process management. The Household and Rates team focuses on the compilation and communication of key features of the household lending and deposit data that the Bank publishes, and quality assurance and management of the granular Product Sales Database (PSD) and Buy to Let (BtL) collections.

Job description
We are recruiting for a Scale H Junior Analyst / Senior RA to work on producing the Bank’s interest rate statistics in the Household and Rates team. The job holder will combine skills in analytical tools, such as R, with an interest in data on household lending and interest rates. The job offers the opportunity of developing both analytical and technical skills, and has the flexibility to be moulded towards the job holder’s current skills.

The job holder would spend approximately half their time producing and explaining the monthly statistics on household lending and interest rates. They would use the knowledge gained from this, and their technical (eg R) skills, to improve the efficiency of data processes across the H&R Team’s varied data sets, and DSD more widely. This work is varied, and could include developing processes for handling loan-level data, visualising data in Tableau dashboards, or working on DSD wide projects to use R to design and implement more automated processes for quality assuring and aggregating data.

The specific responsibilities undertaken by the job holder will depend on their skill set. The role will involve being part of the monthly data round, helping compile and explain movements in the Lending-to-Individuals (LtoI) and/or Effective and Quoted Interest Rates data. This part of the role will take around half the month. As part of this the job holder will:
Conduct due diligence on banks’ returns and MoneyFacts data to understand unusually large movements or spurious stability in the data;
Capture market intelligence from individual banks as part of the due diligence process, identifying common themes and stories that emerge;
Have the opportunity to present the latest developments in the data to other areas of the Bank, for example via presenting at the “Latest Trends in DSD Data” meeting, and writing the Rates Indicator.
Explain technicalities and movements in the data in response to queries from internal and external users.
Depending on the skills and development wishes of the applicant, the job holder will also have the opportunity to be involved in some of the following:
Maintenance and development of Tableau Dashboards to allow a ‘self-service’ culture for data.
Maintaining and developing scripts (R and Python) for obtaining data from MoneyFacts.
Designing and implementing process in R for cleaning loan-level mortgage data.
Use R to design and implement more automated processes for checking and aggregating data, including building on Machine Learning techniques developed in DSD.
Be involved with DSD wide projects, including to use technology to design the future of plausibility checking data, or build a tool that allows effective sharing of information about data returns across teams in DSD.
Contribute to users understanding of our data, for example via writing the Money and Credit Indicator, or statistical release.

The job holder will also be encouraged to actively challenge the way we work, and suggest ways in which we can use technology to work more effectively and inclusively as a team


Role Requirements


Essential criteria

Diversity and Inclusion Lead,TransferWise,"Global Payroll Lead | London
We're looking for a Diversity and Inclusion Lead to help us take positive action and make meaningful progress on our journey towards becoming a truly inclusive and diverse company. You'll bring your awareness and knowledge of inclusion, diversity, equity and equality to a fast-growing company on a mission. You'll help define the vision and work with our teams to make it happen.
Your mission
There's been lots of work on Diversity and Inclusion initiatives in various pockets of TransferWise. You'll help us bring this work together and build a framework and roadmap to make real impact and change.
This isn't a role for someone who typically directs a strategy but doesn't get involved in the doing. Instead, this role would suit someone hands-on who can own and deliver work and also drive accountability in others.
You'll bring together people from across TransferWise as part of the Inclusion and Diversity Guild to focus on specific projects (see 2020 focus areas below), champion different teams by running focused projects and empower inclusive communities and safe spaces for our employees
You'll build tools, resources and best practice to run projects that are scalable and practical so that our people and teams can take action themselves
You'll challenge us to work harder and go beyond performative gestures, guiding teams and leaders to champion inclusion and diversity
You'll build a strategy and focus areas for your work and develop a plan to make it happen. A natural doer, you'll create something, test it, see what works, iterate and empower people to do more themselves
Things that come naturally to you:
Collaboration - You're a team player and can project manage and coordinate global cross-team projects and campaigns (internal and external)
Relationship building - You're someone who builds trust by having open and ongoing (and sometimes hard) conversations to take people across all levels of seniority on a journey towards more awareness, education and inclusion
Problem-solving - You're great at getting to the root of problems, mapping out multiple solutions and then creating practical actions plans that get things moving and have measurable impact and results
Measuring progress - You're comfortable using data to track, measure and report on progress for both internal and external audiences and understand when you've made an impact. You can tell a story and take people on a journey using data
Growing thought leader - You regularly attend industry events, and perhaps you're a contributor to the conversation (Twitter, blogs, etc.). You understand inclusion and diversity is a journey, and you like to keep yourself informed and educated on the topic
This role will give you the opportunity to:
Choose your own path to impact - we believe people are most empowered when they can act autonomously. So rather than telling you what to do, you'll work with your team to create a vision of your own. Of course, you can always gather feedback from smart, curious people across TransferWise but you'll have the freedom to make your own calls
Inspire teams with your ideas and knowledge and self-starting attitude - we're open-minded, we want to learn, and we want you to challenge us. This is an opportunity for you to use your skills to make real change
Grow as a leader and help shape and build Inclusion and Diversity at TransferWise - working within the Employer Brand, Inclusion and Diversity team you'll be a pioneer and champion for the strategy we shape and deliver. We're one of the fastest-growing companies in the world, so your role and remit has the opportunity to grow with us
Example work and projects
Inclusion and diversity is a broad remit. You can't solve everything at once, so you'll work with your Team Lead to narrow your focus on what areas you feel will have the most impact. To give you an idea, below are some of the types of projects you could be working on:
You might work with specific teams, for example, Engineering or Product to solve a diversity or inclusion challenge for example how to achieve gender-balanced applications by widening our candidate pool and funnel
You could think about how we can use an internal voluntary self-identification survey to understand the diversity of our employees and think about how best we can use the data to make interventions and positive impact
We've built the foundations for what inclusion and diversity means for us at TransferWise, but you'll help us take this further and build a narrative that inspires candidates to join us and every employee to feel that they belong and can be themselves at work
Assess and benchmark TransferWise against other companies and within industry to figure out what's best practice
Put in place support systems and safe spaces for our employees from underrepresented communities. Build a framework to grow these communities (for example our Black Lives Matter steering group and allies) and a way to measure impact longer-term
Launch and pilot inclusion training to build cultural awareness and measure the impact
Diversity and Inclusion at TransferWise
TransferWise was built for people without borders - expats, students, immigrants, freelancers, traders, businesses and everyday people from all walks of life. We're proud to have a truly international team from 70+ nationalities, and we celebrate our differences.
Having diverse teams that reflect our diverse customer base helps us build a better product. We can be more creative and empathetic to our customer's needs and life experiences. We want to make sure we leave no-one behind on our journey to making moving money around the world free for everyone.
Inclusive teams help us live our values and make sure every person feels respected, empowered to share their contributions towards our mission and able to progress in their careers.
Our D&I focus areas in 2020 are:

Attraction and hiring

Our goal is to increase the number of people who identify as women to apply for Product and Engineering roles and build awareness of our career proposition in target communities
We're working hard to build a fair and inclusive hiring process to mitigate bias, evaluate candidates fairly and consistently and measure progress

Learning and development

Increase our knowledge of our employee and candidate diversity to see where we have areas that we can focus on to make the most impactful interventions to increase diversity and build inclusion
Help our leads and their teams create an open and inclusive, trusting environment where people feel safe to be themselves.

Support for all

Build a framework that empowers Inclusive Communities and safe spaces for our people to celebrate our different communities
Help our employees build empathy and an understanding of each other and increase our knowledge of inclusion and difference
Your team
Your role will sit within the Employer Brand, Inclusion and Diversity team, reporting into the Global Lead for Employer Brand, Inclusion and Diversity. We're a small team and you'll be our first hire focused purely on D&I.
Based in the People team, we're collaborators in the truest sense focusing on internal and external programmes across the full candidate/employee journey. Teams we work closest with are: Recruitment, PR, Internal Comms and Brand, Performance Marketing (Paid and Organic Social), People Operations, People Reward, People Development, People Analytics, Design, Creative & Buzz to name a few!
We then bring people together as part of the Diversity and Inclusion Guild. Guilds are an alliance of people with the same skillset or working on similar projects that come together regularly to align on what they're working on, plan and share knowledge. Examples include the Analytics, iOS, D&I and Android Guilds. You can read more about how we work in this guide.
We're people without borders — without judgement or prejudice, too. We want to work with the best people, no matter their background. So if you're passionate about learning new things and keen to join our mission, you'll fit right in.

Also, qualifications aren't that important to us. If you've got great experience, and you're great at articulating your thinking, we'd like to hear from you.

And because we believe that diverse teams build better products, we'd especially love to hear from you if you're from an under-represented demographic.

Office: London
Salary range: £50,000 to £70,000

About MySense
MySense is a wellbeing analytics platform built on compassion, by people who understand what it's like to care for a loved one. But we're also a team of dedicated (selfproclaimed) nerds, tech is what we know and love. So, we have combined these two drives and created a product we can be proud of.
The idea is that peace of mind about a loved one's wellbeing should be at people's fingertips no matter who or where they are. To do this, we created a wearable device and 11 sensors that can be placed around someone's home. Each sensor picks up information about a key activity. This means looking at drinking and eating habits, toilet usage, sleep patterns and heart rate (approximately 5,000 data points). These sensors collect data that our AI then analyses for any patterns of decline in wellbeing. When we start to notice that something isn't looking ideal, we send caregivers notifications so they can address problems before they escalate.

FMID oversees all aspects of the regulation of Financial Market Infrastructure in one directorate, bringing together supervisors, policy experts, risk specialists and researchers in one place. The team supervises some of the most systemically significant firms in the world, including the UK's central counterparties (CCPs), payment systems and central securities depositories (CSDs).

FMID is a small directorate; this means there are plenty of opportunities for cross-cutting work and the opportunity to get an insight into how different areas operate.

Learning about financial market infrastructure can also set you up for your career within the wider Bank, as shown by the fact that a large number of senior people across the Bank have spent time in FMID, and it is a good way to understand the interlinkages right at the heart of the financial system.

In addition, you will provide support to other directorates across the Bank wishing to make use of the datasets managed by FMID. We would expect the work to be interesting and challenging; and to offer some opportunities to demonstrate the capacity to work at higher scales, i.e. a scale G level.

Key responsibilities will include:
Becoming an expert on how FMI-related datasets, in particular the Trade Repository (TR) derivatives dataset and the CCP regulatory return dataset, are used to support FMID’s policy and supervisory objectives, and its external reporting obligations
Querying big datasets to regularly produce Key Risk Indicator packs which are circulated to senior management at the Bank
Using the Bank’s data platforms and tools to draw statistics and conclusions from the datasets, thus answering queries from a wide range of internal and external stakeholders
Contributing to the team’s work in delivering briefings and visualisations which drive financial stability policy making
Contributing to the FMI Data team’s work on improving data quality and existing data-related processes

Role Requirements
You do not need to have prior knowledge of FMIs. However, you will be able to explain how your experience is relevant to FMID and have a demonstrated ability to pick up and apply new areas of knowledge quickly.
Good Microsoft Excel skills and some experience in using R for statistical analysis and visualisation, or ability and willingness to learn R
Good problem-solving skills and proven ability to deliver statistics and charts from datasets
An interest in the global financial markets and the role played by FMIs
Ability to manage workload and prioritise incoming requests for data from various different stakeholders
