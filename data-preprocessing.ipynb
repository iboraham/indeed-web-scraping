The interview technical arrangements will be agreed in advance with the candidate (probably Skype). The successful candidate would start ASAP thereafter.\\n\\nIt is likely that the initial period in post would be undertaken remotely, until such time as government guidance advises on the safety of the lifting of current restrictions.
