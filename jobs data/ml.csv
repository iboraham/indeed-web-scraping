"Engineer, Machine Learning",OakNorth Bank,"OakNorth is the next-generation credit and monitoring platform that provides banks and lending institutions with the insight and foresight needed to create a better borrowing experience for the Missing Middle – the growth business who are the backbones of communities and economies globally but who have been in banking’s blind spot for decades.
The business was founded in 2015 by Rishi Khosla and Joel Perlman, who previously co-founded Copal Amba and grew it to 3,000 employees over 12 years, before selling it to Moody’s (NYSE: MCO) in 2014, returning 125 times capital to seed investors.
Since its inception, OakNorth has secured over $1bn from several investors, including: Clermont Group, Coltrane, EDBI of Singapore, GIC, Indiabulls, NIBC, Toscafund, and SoftBank’s Vision Fund.
The Platform has been deployed at various banks across North America, Europe, and Asia, and in the UK where OakNorth lends off of its own balance sheet via OakNorth Bank. The platform has helped OakNorth Bank become the fastest-growing business in Europe according to the Financial Times FT 1000 (2020), profitably lending over £4bn to date. In terms of the impact this has had on the economy, OakNorth Bank’s loans have directly helped with the creation of 13,000 new homes and 17,000 new jobs in the UK, as well as adding several billion pounds to the economy.
With offices in London, New York, Manchester, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Istanbul, Gurgaon and Bangalore, the global team across the OakNorth Holdings group is over 800 people.

SMEs are crucial in the global economy. Although they account for 99% of business in the UK/US, their financing need is increasingly difficult to be met by major banks, due to higher risk of default and the diversity of different sectors in that make up ""SME"".
To solve this problem, OakNorth is building a platform to improve productivity of SME lenders. From credit appraisal, to loan monitoring, the OakNorth Machine Learning team has identified multiple key areas that can be optimised by recent advances in Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and Information Retrieval (IR).

Research Scientist - Machine Learning,Transformative AI,"ABOUT TRANSFORMATIVE
Born out of CERN and the University of Cambridge, we are tackling serious medical conditions with a mixture of machine learning and advanced statistical tools. Our team is composed of world experts in deep learning, cardiology, bioinformatics and data science.
Predictive analytics is the next frontier in medicine. Today, patients with chronic medical conditions suffer life-threatening disease complications without warning. Tomorrow, patients and healthcare providers will use Transformative tools to identify subtle physiologic changes that precede symptom onset, enabling personalised preparation and prevention.
Annually, 6 million people die of Sudden Cardiac Arrest. Yet, no available technology warns patients or healthcare providers of an oncoming arrest. We’re changing this.

Quantum Machine Learning Scientist,Cambridge Quantum Computing,"Quantum Machine Learning Scientist
Location: London, Victoria
Salary: Competitive Salary
Closing Date: 26th July 2020
Research at Cambridge Quantum Computing
Quantum machine learning (QML) is one of the most interesting applications of quantum computers. For example, parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) can be trained to perform tasks such as classification, regression, and generative modelling (see our recent Topical Review [1] for an introduction).
QML algorithms can be successfully implemented using hybrid quantum-classical systems and are amongst the most promising techniques to show a near-term impact on real-world problems. Firstly, it has been empirically shown that they can cope with noise, a limited number of quantum bits, and shallow circuits. Secondly, it has been theoretically shown that some classes of circuits have remarkable expressive power and share many aspects with classical neural network models. Also, QML borrows many concepts with Deep Learning and other areas of statistical learning and these links have not been thoroughly explored; in this respect, it offers great opportunities to Machine Learning experts interested in quantum computing applications.
The field is thriving with new ideas and open questions such as proving quantum advantage, assessing computational complexity, designing variational circuits, and efficient state preparation, to name a few.

Building a start up from scratch is exciting. But terrifying.

The vision is there, but lack of funds, tiny teams of engineers all with ridiculous workloads, the pressure of not yet making any revenue all makes it difficult. The inability to do anything, or actually get any products to market, or having a VC peering over your shoulder all add to the risk.

Building that same start up however, funded by an established organisation, alleviates all those concerns.

Sitting as effectively an incubator within a global cash rich company means you can adopt that vital technology, you can hire that great Engineer you've interviewed, you can get a great product to market quickly without needing to cut corners. You have all the tools and funds at your disposal to ensure great products are built quickly, marketed well and you can see the fruits of your hard labour.

We have an opportunity to work with a genuine market leader, building a start up within (fully autonomous) to begin their next phase of market domination. Revolution and Disruption may be applicable terms.

We're looking for someone who can combine hands on technical experience with Cloud, DevOps, Data Analytics and Machine Learning along with the ability to manage and motivate (and hire) a talented team of Engineers. Currently sitting at 1 DevOp, 2 Data Engineers and 2 Software Engineers.

The Company
causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.
causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.
causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.
